<img src="./fresh-kds-logo-full-black.png" width="300px"/>

## Introduction

The main purpose of this project is to get a sense of how you think about structuring your code for maintainability and reusability - effectively, how it is that you communicate utilizing code. At a minimum, your submission should compile and run. Projects that are successful will also include a README detailing what steps need to be taken to execute the project, locally.

### Disclaimer

We are not looking for this to be something on which you spend a great deal of time; our Engineers estimate that this should take no longer than three-to-four hours of coding. Ultimately, this project acts as an additional criterion to be used to differentiate candidates and to better demonstrate candidate technical capabilities.

## Requirements

1. Retrieve information from any open, public API. 
1. Display data from that API.
1. Enable a detail view of some entity returned from the API.
1. The applicatiom must run on both iOS and Android emulators.

## Code Expectations

1. Follow any preferred pattern for structuring your project; we are a .NET Xamarin shop currently, so [MVVM](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/maui/mvvm#the-mvvm-pattern) would be the most-relevant choice to our work, here. 
1. Use bindings as the mechanism to display data in the UI.
1. Use events and triggers (commands) to handle user interactions with the application, such as a user tapping the screen.

## Submission

Please, submit your project to the Hiring Manager for the position; ideally utilizing GitHub.
